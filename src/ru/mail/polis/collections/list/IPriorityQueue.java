 * <p>A binary heap is defined as a binary sorted with two additional constraints:
 * <p> Shape property: a binary heap is a complete binary sorted;
 * that is, all levels of the sorted, except possibly the last one (deepest) are fully filled,
 * and, if the last level of the sorted is not complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.
 * <p>Heap property: the key stored in each node is either
 * greater than or equal to
 * or less than or equal to
 * the keys in the node's children, according to some total order.

 * @param <E> the type of elements maintained by this priority queue
